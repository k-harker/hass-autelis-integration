This is the beginnings of an [Autelis Pool Controller](http://autelis.com/) integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Currently this integration supports:

* A config UI that allows you to enter the host and password of your Autelis controller
* Switches for the Pumps allowing you to turn them On and Off
* Sensors for 
    * Air Temp
    * Solar Temp
    * Spa Temp
    * Pool Temp
